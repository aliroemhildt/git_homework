1. Time management, organization, having a detailed calendar, and staying on-schedule is a big key to success
2. It's important to exhaust all resources when you're stuck before going to an instructor. Check your notes/slides, google, ask peers, and THEN ask an instructor. This is how you will problem-solve on the job.
